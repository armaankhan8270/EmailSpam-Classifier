# Spam Email Classifier

## Introduction

The **Spam Email Classifier** is a web application that uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam. Built with Python and Flask, this project showcases how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques can be applied to filter unwanted emails.

This project is aimed at helping users automatically detect spam emails, enhancing their email management and reducing the time spent on filtering out unwanted messages manually.

## Features

- **Spam Detection:** Classifies emails as spam or not spam using trained machine learning models.
- **User Authentication:** Allows users to sign up and log in to check the classification of their emails.
- **Real-time Classification:** Provides immediate feedback on whether an email is spam or not.
- **User Dashboard:** Displays a history of classified emails.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface for easy access on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the application logic.
- **Flask:** A web framework for developing the web application.
- **Pandas and Numpy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning model training and prediction.
- **NLTK:** For natural language processing tasks.
- **SQLite:** For the database management.
- **Bootstrap:** For front-end styling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- SQLite (or any other SQL database)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
    cd spam-email-classifier
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

6. **Access the Application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Register or Log In:**
   Sign up for an account or log in with your existing credentials.

2. **Classify Emails:**
   Go to the dashboard and submit your email text to get it classified as spam or not spam.

3. **View History:**
   Check the history of your classified emails on the dashboard.

4. **Update Profile:**
   Manage your account details and preferences.


## Machine Learning Model

- **Data Preprocessing:** Emails are preprocessed to remove noise and extract meaningful features using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.
- **Model Training:** A variety of algorithms, such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are used to train the classifier.
- **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance.
